# MyWearCalendar

Test in a web browser: (This is not the intended platform but should be used to test some device independent features)
*notice: when viewing on a webpage the calendar will have static data. This is because the calendar usually would read the calendar       
info from the mobile device. Also the change location function doesnt work on the browser as this is also a mobile device dependent       
feature. To test these please foloow instructions below and build on ios or android.
      
      git clone <repo name>

      cd into new repo
  
      npm install
  
      ionic serve (assuming you have ionic cli downloaded)
  
Test for IOS device:
  
    git clone <repo name>
  
    cd into new repo
  
    npm install
